<p>Majora’s Mask(ゼルダの伝説 ムジュラの仮面) takes place in the “Child Timeline”</p>
<p>Now personally I think this is one of the better games in the series due to the fact that it has a darker undertone and puts Link in a different setting rather than Hyrule. Link found himself in a land of Termina where there’s a mask that can turn anyone into a “puppet” and use their body to cause mayhem.</p>
