  <p>I personally love Majora’s Mask the most because it was the game that got me hooked on the Legend of Zelda franchise in the first place. Majora’s mask is the first game I actually played start to finish.</p>

   <div class="item4">
  <font color="black">I decided to go off the opinion of Benjamin and why he thinks Ocarina of time is better. "Ocarina of Time is by far the best Legand of Zelda game because of a few reasons. Reason 1 is that it spreads out the story line. Without Ocarina of Time Majora's Mask would have never happened. Reason 2 is that Ocarina of Time has the best Soundtrack with songs like The Song of Storms, Song of Time, Sarahs song, and The Great Fairy Fountain which is personally my favortie. Reason 3 is that it popularized the Ocarina with the actual Ocarina of Time and All the different songs you can play on it."</p></font>
